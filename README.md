**ðŸ’¡ Insights & Recommendations**

**Insights**

â€¢	Age Distribution: Most customers fall within the middle age range (between 30 and 50 years). There are fewer customers in the younger and older age groups.

â€¢	Annual Income Distribution: The majority of customers have annual incomes between 25000 and 75000. Fewer customers fall into higher income brackets.

â€¢	Occupation Diversity: Customers come from various professions, including writers, programmers, executives, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and more. This diversity suggests a broad occupational background among the customer base.

â€¢	Credit Mix: The credit mix is categorized into â€˜Bad,â€™ â€˜Standard,â€™ and â€˜Good.â€™ The â€˜Standardâ€™ category has the highest count, indicating a balanced mix of credit profiles.

â€¢	distribution of customers by credit score:

â€¢	Good (670-740): Largest group, 44.2%.

â€¢	Fair (580-670): Second largest, 25.0%.

â€¢	Very Good (740-800): 17.9%.

â€¢	Poor (<580): 11.2%.

â€¢	Exceptional (>=800): Smallest group, 1.7%.

â€¢	Most customers have "Good" scores, while a significant portion falls into "Fair" or "Poor," indicating potential risk.
Positive Relationships:

â€¢	Age: Older individuals tend to have higher credit scores.

â€¢	Credit History Age: Longer credit history is associated with higher credit scores.
Negative Relationships:

â€¢	Num Bank Accounts: Having more bank accounts is associated with lower credit scores.

â€¢	Delay_from_due_date: Longer delays from due dates lead to lower credit scores.

â€¢	Num_of_Delayed_Payment: More delayed payments are linked to lower credit scores.

â€¢	Outstanding_Debt: Higher outstanding debt correlates with lower credit scores.

â€¢	Num_Credit_Inquiries: More credit inquiries result in lower credit scores.

â€¢	Num_of_Loan: Having more loans is associated with lower credit scores.

â€¢	Neutral Relationship: Credit_Utilization_Ratio: No statistically significant relationship with credit scores.

Credit Mix: Having a mix of credit (loans and credit cards) can be beneficial, but too many can negatively impact scores. Frequent credit inquiries suggest credit-seeking behavior, potentially lowering scores.

Payment Behavior: Consistent on-time payments are crucial for good credit scores. Late payments and high outstanding debt significantly harm credit scores.

**Recommendations**

Maintain a healthy mix of credit, avoiding excessive accounts. Prioritize timely payments and minimize outstanding debt. Limit credit inquiries to essential needs.
